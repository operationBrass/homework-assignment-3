# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

A random password generator giving the user 4 criteria to choose from. Some interesting aspects were ensuring all passwords contained the users criteria regardless of length, using prompts, confirm and alerts, plus as a bonus, copying content to the clipboard. Password range is from 8-128 characters. The password box is extendable for the user to adjust if password is to long and cannot see it all.
